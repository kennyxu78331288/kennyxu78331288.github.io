  <h1>Tom and Max: A Funny Story</h1>

  <p>Tom had always wanted a smart dog. What he hadn’t considered was just <span class="highlight">how</span> smart a Border Collie could be. When he brought home Max, a fluffy black-and-white puppy with eyes that looked like he was plotting world domination, Tom thought he was prepared. He was wrong.</p>

  <p>The first sign came during breakfast. Tom sat with his toast and coffee, scrolling on his phone. He left the butter on the table. When he looked up again, the butter was gone. Max was sitting politely on the floor, licking his lips. Tom blinked. “Did you just steal my butter?” Max wagged his tail like a criminal pleased with his perfect heist.</p>

  <p>Later that day, Tom decided to teach Max a trick: fetch the newspaper. “Simple,” Tom thought. He opened the door, pointed, and said, “Newspaper, Max!” Max sprinted out like a bullet. Five minutes later, he returned, proudly carrying… the neighbor’s <span class="highlight">slippers</span>.</p>

  <p>“Not bad,” Tom said, trying not to laugh. “But not the newspaper.” Max barked once, offended, and dashed off again. This time, he came back with the neighbor’s <span class="highlight">mail</span>. Then someone’s <span class="highlight">hat</span>. By the time Max finally dragged in the actual newspaper, Tom’s porch looked like a yard sale.</p>

  <p>Still, Tom couldn’t deny Max’s brilliance. One morning, Tom found Max sitting at his desk, staring at his laptop. Somehow, the collie had pawed the spacebar and opened YouTube. The screen played a video titled <span class="highlight">‘How to Train Your Human.’</span> Max was watching intently. Tom wasn’t sure whether to laugh or start panicking.</p>

  <p>Things escalated during their daily walks. Whenever Tom tried to lead, Max would tug the leash in the opposite direction. Eventually, Max began “herding” Tom—circling around him, nudging his legs, and steering him toward the park bench. Passersby laughed as Tom stumbled along, clearly outmatched. One old lady clapped and said, “Smart dog you’ve got there! He’s walking <span class="highlight">you!</span>”</p>

  <p>The most embarrassing moment happened at the grocery store. Tom tied Max outside for just two minutes while he grabbed some milk. When he came back, Max had somehow convinced three different strangers to throw him sticks. There was even a small crowd cheering him on like he was an entertainer. Tom apologized, but Max simply trotted up, wagging his tail as if to say, <span class="highlight">“See? I’m the star of the show.”</span></p>

  <p>That night, Tom collapsed on the couch, exhausted. Max jumped up beside him, resting his head on Tom’s lap with a satisfied sigh. Tom sighed too, stroking his dog’s head. “You’re way too clever for your own good, you know that?”</p>

  <p>Max licked his hand once, then gently nudged the TV remote toward him with his paw—like a reminder: <span class="highlight">“Turn on my show.”</span></p>

  <p>Tom laughed so hard he nearly dropped the remote. “Fine, boss. You win.”</p>

  <p>And from that day forward, Tom realized the truth: you don’t <span class="highlight">own</span> a Border Collie. A Border Collie owns <span class="highlight">you.</span></p>
